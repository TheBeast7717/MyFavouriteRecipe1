**Cooking Procedure**

*The potatoes and green peas have to be cooked together first.*

**Cooking In Stovetop Pressure Cooker :-**

◼ In a 3 or 4 litre pressure cooker take 4 to 5 large potatoes and 2.5 cups water. 

◼ Place a small trivet and keep a bowl containing ½ cup green peas in it. Pressure cook for 5 to 6 whistles on medium to medium-high flame.

**Making Green Peas Stuffing :-**

◼ Drain the water from the steamed green peas using a small strainer or colander. Take the peas in a bowl and mash them.

◼ Mash to a coarse texture.

◼ To the peas, add red chilli powder or cayenne pepper, coriander powder, fennel powder, dry mango powder, finely chopped ginger, green chillies, coriander leaves, black salt and regular salt as per taste.

◼ Mix very well. Check taste and add more salt or spice powders if required.

**Making Potato Mixture :-**

◼ Meanwhile drain the water from the potatoes as well and let them become warm.

◼ When the potatoes are warm, then peel them and grate. One can find it easier to grate the potatoes and then mash them. However, you can also chop them and mash with a potato masher. 

◼ Let the grated or mashed potatoes cool completely.

◼ After the mashed potatoes have cooled completely, add the following ingredients: red chilli powder or cayenne pepper, garam masala powder or curry powder, coriander powder, dry mango powder, black salt and regular salt as per taste.

◼ Next add bread crumbs and arrowroot flour. Instead of arrowroot flour, you can also add rice flour, corn flour (corn starch) or tapioca starch or roasted besan (roasted chickpea flour or roasted gram flour).

◼ Mix everything very well.

**Stuffing And Shaping Aloo Tikki :-**

◼ Divide the mixture into small or medium shaped patties with a hollow center or cup shaped discs. You can apply some oil on your palms when making the patties or tikki.

◼ Place the green peas filling in the center.

◼ Bring the mashed potato edges on the top and seal them.

◼ Roll gently between your palms and gently flatten. Make all aloo tikki this way.

**Frying Aloo Tikki :- **

◼ Heat 2 tablespoons oil till on a skillet or tawa or frying pan till it is medium hot. Gently place the tikki and begin to pan-fry them.

◼ When the base is crispy and golden, gently flip each tikki with a spatula.

◼ Fry the second side till crispy and golden. You can gently flip once or twice more till the aloo tikki are golden and crisp evenly.

◼ Remove and place in a strainer kept on top of a bowl. You can even drain them on paper towels. Fry all tikkis this way. Add 2 tablespoons more oil when frying the second batch.

***Serve Aloo Tikki plain with coriander chutney & tamarind chutney. You can also serve these potato patties with sweet yogurt raita , pomegrenate , pulses , chickpeas etc.***
